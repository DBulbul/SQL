A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.


SELECT CAST(ROUND((
(
 (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM
   (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N) AS BottomHalf)
 +
 (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM
   (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N DESC) AS TopHalf)
)/ 2),4) AS NUMERIC(19,4));
